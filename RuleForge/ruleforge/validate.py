"""Graph validation, and the ReDoS screen on the DEPLOY path.

WHY THE REGEX SCREEN IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN THE EVALUATOR
-----------------------------------------------------------
The catastrophic-backtracking check in `evaluate.py` only runs when a rule is
EXECUTED locally. That is the wrong side of the boundary. The product is a rule
someone deploys to an agent or an indexer that has none of these guards, so a
pattern that RuleForge would refuse to run locally must also never be *authored*
or *rendered* by it.

Concretely: a Wazuh rule whose field regex is `([a-c]?x|[a-c]?y)+$` is perfectly
representable -- it renders to valid XML, the lowerer is happy, and the author
path reports success. It is also a pattern that will hang the Wazuh agent's
regex engine in production, which is the manager, not the search. So the screen
is called from `validate_graph`, which every author and render path goes through.

It is DIALECT-BLIND on purpose. The pattern is going to be executed by somebody
else's engine, and which dialect this tool thinks it is in does not change what
that engine will do with the bytes.
