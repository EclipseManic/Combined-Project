"""Elastic Security EQL: the dialect that needed a new IR node.

EQL is the one language here whose central construct the model could not
already express:

    sequence by host.id with maxspan=5m
      [process where process.name == "procdump.exe"]
      [process where process.name == "lsass.exe"]
    until [process where event.type == "end"]

**A sequence is ORDERED, and nothing in the IR carried order.** `ir.Join`
pairs two streams where keys match and says nothing about which came first.
`ir.Correlation` counts how often ONE condition fired. Neither can say "this,
then that, within five minutes, on the same host" -- so `ir.Sequence` and
`ir.SequenceStep` exist, and their docstrings record why. Lowering a sequence
to a join would double the matches and half of them would be the benign
direction: `procdump` then `lsass` is credential dumping, and `lsass` then
`procdump` is somebody inspecting a memory tool.

**`:` is not `==`.** EQL's `:` is a case-INSENSITIVE wildcard match and `==`
is exact and case-sensitive. They look interchangeable and are not:
`process.name : "LSASS*"` matches `lsass.exe`, and `==` with the same string
matches nothing at all. Collapsing `:` into `==` silently narrows every rule
that used it, and collapsing `==` into `:` silently widens every rule that
did not. `MATCH_OPERATORS` keeps the two apart as data.

**The event category is a predicate, not a table.** `process where ...` filters
`event.category == "process"`; it does not name an index. Modelling it as the
table loses it on the way to any dialect that reads a different stream, and
modelling `any where ...` as a table called `any` names an index that does not
exist. The category becomes an ordinary condition, which is what it is, and
`CATEGORY_FIELD` records the field it tests.

**`maxspan` bounds the whole sequence, not each gap.** A per-gap window lets
five steps stretch across five windows and still fire, which is not the bound
the rule wrote.

**`until` is a cancellation.** A chain that was abandoned -- the user logged
off, the process exited -- is not a detection, and completing it anyway
reports an attack that did not happen.

**Regex is a Java/Lucene flavour.** `regex` and `match` hand their pattern to
Elasticsearch, so `evaluate.py` refuses to execute it for the same reason it
refuses PCRE. `:` and `wildcard()` are glob tests rather than regexes and DO
execute, which is what most EQL rules use.
