"""The dialect registry: one lookup point for every vendor language.

Every caller above this package -- the HTTP API, the GUI, a test -- asks for a
dialect BY KEY and gets back functions. None of them import a vendor module
directly, which is what keeps vendor knowledge from leaking upward into code
that should not have it.

Three things make this a registry rather than a dict:

**Modules are imported on demand.** Eight parsers is a lot of import time to
pay for a caller that wanted one, and a half-finished dialect must not be able
to break `import ruleforge.dialects` for the seven that work.

**Unimplemented dialects are listed, not omitted.** A key with no module is
declared `planned`, so the GUI can show a greyed-out entry and `get()` can
answer "planned, not implemented" instead of "unknown dialect". A roadmap that
lives in data cannot drift from a roadmap that lives in a docstring -- which is
exactly what happened here before: three separate docstrings claimed eight
dialects while one existed.

**Capabilities are declared and then asserted.** `can_parse` and `can_render`
are written down per dialect, and `tests/test_dialects.py` imports every ready
dialect and fails if the declaration does not match the module. A dialect that
claims it can parse and cannot is worse than one that admits it cannot, because
the first silently returns an empty rule and the second refuses.

    `ir.Annotations` is the part of a rule a SOC acts on: the name an alert
    fires under, the severity it is routed by, the technique it is attributed
    to. Five of these dialects rendered all of it as nothing, so converting a
    Sigma rule -- the most common thing this tool will be asked to do -- came
    out as an unnamed, unrated query. The text looked complete and the call
    reported success.

    Three of those five now write a comment header and read it back. SPL and
    FQL genuinely cannot: `render_splunk`'s docstring makes the argument, which
    is that SPL's metadata lives in a `savedsearches.conf` stanza and a comment
    would put triage data somewhere no Splunk search reads; and FQL is a single
    filter string with no comment syntax at all. Those two drop it -- but they
    now SAY so, which is the whole difference.
