"""Splunk SPL: a pipeline language, like KQL, with three traps KQL does not have.

`kql.py` is the model this module follows -- a `DialectSpec`, a `parse_*` that
SPLITS the pipeline, a stage dispatcher, and a renderer whose dispatch ends in
refusals. Where SPL differs, it differs in ways that are silent when got wrong.

**Implicit AND.** `index=main EventCode=4624 user=svc` is three predicates ANDed,
with nothing written between them. The shared parser cannot see that: after
reading `EventCode=4624` it looks for an infix operator, finds the identifier
`user`, and stops -- leaving the rest of the search SILENTLY UNREAD. That is the
exact failure `common.py`'s docstring warns about, and it produces a rule that
runs, reports success, and matches far more events than it says. So the search
grammar is normalised first: adjacent terms get an explicit `AND` inserted, and
only then does it go through the shared parser, where `and`/`or`/`not`
precedence comes from the same table every other dialect uses.

**Case matters in a search.** `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` are operators only in
uppercase. Lowercase `and` is a search TERM -- Splunk looks for the literal word.
Folding the two together would turn a search for the word "and" into a boolean,
so the normaliser treats only the uppercase forms as operators.

**`search` and `where` are different grammars.** `| search status=200` is
search-term syntax; `| where status=200` is eval syntax, where Splunk itself
rejects a single `=`. They are not interchangeable, so they are lowered by
different functions rather than by one that squints at both.

Two honest limits, stated here because they are the kind of thing that looks like
a bug:

`index=`, `sourcetype=` and friends go into `Read.selector` VERBATIM and are
never evaluated locally. They are index-time filters, resolved by the indexer
before any event exists, so treating them as row predicates would let a local
run claim a match it cannot produce. `run.py` emits an `INDEX_TIME_FILTER`
caveat, which also means a non-match on an SPL rule is reported as
`not_evaluated` rather than as a confident `no_match`.

SPL regex is PCRE, so `Regex.dialect` is `pcre`, and `evaluate.py` REFUSES to
execute PCRE locally rather than running it with Python's `re` and calling the
result Splunk. A pattern-matching SPL rule therefore lowers and renders
correctly and cannot be test-run here. That is the intended behaviour: the
alternative is a false claim about a security control.

#: SPL regex is PCRE. Modelled honestly, which means `evaluate.py` refuses to
#: run it: there is no PCRE engine here, and using Python's `re` and calling the
#: answer Splunk would be a false claim about a detection.
#:
#: TWO specs, because SPL has two grammars with DIFFERENT PRECEDENCE, and this is
#: the single most dangerous thing about the language.
#:
#: Splunk's documented evaluation order for the SEARCH language is: parentheses,
#: then NOT, then OR, then AND. OR binds TIGHTER than AND -- the opposite of
#: every C-like language and of this engine's shared default. So
#: `a=1 OR b=2 c=3` means `(a=1 OR b=2) AND c=3` in a search, and
#: `a=1 OR (b=2 AND c=3)` under the usual precedence. Those select different
#: events, nothing warns, and the rule reads identically either way.
#:
#: The eval language used by `| where` follows the ordinary order, where AND
#: binds tighter. One table for both would therefore be wrong for one of them.
