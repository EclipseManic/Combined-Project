"""Shared parsing machinery for the dialects.

Eight vendor languages, one tokenizer and one expression parser. The
differences between them are small and DATA, not code: an operator precedence
table, a keyword set, a string-literal style, a comment style. Writing that as
eight hand-rolled parsers is how a tool ends up with eight subtly different
readings of `a and b or c` -- and a precedence difference is invisible in review
and produces a rule that matches a different set of events than the author
wrote.

So: one parser, driven by a `DialectSpec`. The spec is where a vendor's
peculiarities live, which means the peculiarities are DATA and can be asserted
about rather than rediscovered in eight places.
