"""IBM QRadar AQL: the dialect where written order is not execution order.

Every other dialect in this package reads in the order it runs. SPL pipes
left to right, KQL pipes top to bottom, Sigma's `detection` is a set of
selections. AQL is SQL, and SQL is written in an order that has almost nothing
to do with the order it executes:

    SELECT   sourceip, COUNT(*)   <- written FIRST, runs LAST
    FROM     events
    WHERE    qid = 28250080       <- runs SECOND
    GROUP BY sourceip             <- runs THIRD
    HAVING   COUNT(*) > 5         <- runs FOURTH
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT    10
    LAST 24 HOURS                 <- runs FIRST, before any row exists

**This is the defect this module exists to avoid.** `ir.Rule.pipeline` is an
ordered stream: stage N sees what stage N-1 produced. Lowering AQL clauses in
the order they are WRITTEN puts the `SELECT` projection at the front, which
drops every column the `WHERE` has not read yet. The filter then compares
ABSENT against its literal, the comparison goes UNDECIDED, and the rule
reports a clean `no_match` on events it was written to catch. So
`_lower_clauses` reorders deliberately, and `CLAUSE_EXECUTION_ORDER` states
the order as data so it can be asserted about rather than inferred from the
shape of a function.

**`'x'` is a string, `"x"` is a column.** AQL follows SQL here, and it is the
exact opposite of the convention in most of the other dialects. QRadar needs
it because its property names contain spaces -- `"Event Name"`,
`"Log Source"`, `"Account Name"` -- so a quoted identifier is the normal case
rather than an exotic one. Reading `"admin"` as a string makes
`WHERE username = "admin"` a comparison between the `username` column and a
column called `admin`, which does not exist: every row is then ABSENT = ABSENT,
and the rule either matches nothing or matches everything depending on which
way the engine resolves two absences. The shared tokenizer collapses both
quote styles into one `string` token, so `_tokenise_aql` re-reads the original
character at each token's offset to recover the distinction.

**`LAST 24 HOURS` is not a row filter.** It is the Ariel time range, resolved
against the index before any record is read. It is kept on `Read.selector`
verbatim and never evaluated locally, for the same reason a Sigma `logsource`
and an SPL `index=` are: treating it as a predicate would let a local run
claim a match it cannot actually produce.

**`MATCHES` is Java regex.** `evaluate.py` refuses to execute it, as it
refuses PCRE, because no Java regex engine is implemented here and running the
pattern with Python's `re` while calling the result Java would be a false
claim about a security control. `LIKE` and `ILIKE` are SQL wildcard tests, not
regexes, and those DO execute -- which is what most AQL rules use, so most of
them stay testable.

**`WHERE` and `HAVING` are not interchangeable.** `WHERE` filters rows before
grouping; `HAVING` filters groups after it. Lowering `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5` as
a `WHERE` asks each individual row whether its own count exceeds five, which
is never true, and the rule silently stops firing.

**`COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(field)` are different counts.** SQL's `COUNT(field)`
skips NULLs; `COUNT(*)` counts rows. A threshold rule written against
`COUNT(authfail)` and lowered as `COUNT(*)` fires on rows where the field is
absent, which is the wrong population.
