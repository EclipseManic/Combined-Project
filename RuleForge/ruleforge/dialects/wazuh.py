"""Wazuh XML: the dialect this codebase's architecture was built around.

Several docstrings in this package cite one defect as the reason nothing here
is allowed a silent fallback -- `render_kql`'s names it directly: "the defect
that once made a Wazuh rule match every event while reporting success." This
module is the one most able to reproduce it, because in Wazuh an absence is a
match. A `<rule>` with no matchers fires on every event the parent passed; a
matcher that gets dropped widens the detection and nothing says so.

So this module refuses in places another dialect would shrug:

* An empty `<rule>` is REFUSED, not lowered to a pass-through.
* An unrecognised element is REFUSED BY NAME, never skipped.
* A `<group>` holding several rules is REFUSED unless the caller says which one,
  because lowering the first and discarding the rest hides detections.

Three Wazuh-specific decisions worth stating:

**`<match>` is a substring test, `<regex>` is OS-Regex, `<pcre2>` is PCRE2, and
they are not interchangeable.** OS-Regex has no grouping parentheses and no
bracket classes, so `(a|b)` and `[a-z]` are partly literal text in Wazuh and are
operators everywhere else. `evaluate.py` therefore refuses to execute both
`os_regex` and `pcre2` locally. `<match>` lowers to `contains`, which does
execute -- and that is what most real Wazuh rules use, so most of them stay
testable.

**`<if_sid>` and `<if_matched_sid>` are different things.** `if_sid` is a
PRECONDITION: this rule only looks at events the parent rule already matched. It
narrows the input, so it belongs on the source stage. `if_matched_sid` is a
CORRELATION: fire when the parent matched N times inside a timeframe. It is a
threshold over a stream, so it becomes `ir.Correlation`. Treating the first as
the second invents a threshold the rule does not have; treating the second as
the first drops the threshold entirely and fires on a single event.

**`<same_source_ip>` and friends are the correlation's group_by.** Dropping them
turns a per-host threshold into a global one -- five failures spread across five
machines would fire a rule that means five failures on ONE machine.
