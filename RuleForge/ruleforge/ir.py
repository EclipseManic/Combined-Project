"""The dialect-neutral rule model.

Design stance, and it differs deliberately from a validator:

    Represent everything. Evaluate what can be evaluated. Label the rest.

An enterprise detection rule is mostly things a laptop cannot execute -- QRadar
appliance functions, Splunk `tstats` over index-time fields, PCRE, Wazuh
correlation evaluated on the agent. A tool that refuses those refuses the rule.
So every node carries a `capability`: EVALUATED means the local run is
trustworthy, DECLARED_ONLY means the node is modelled faithfully and renders
correctly but only the vendor's engine can execute it, and that fact is rendered
onto the artifact so it travels with the rule instead of living only in a log.

WHAT IS NEVER ALLOWED
---------------------
Silently dropping a node, and silently approximating one. Every dispatch chain
over node types terminates in an explicit refusal rather than a silent `else`.
An empty answer that looks like a working answer is the failure mode that
destroys trust in a detection tool, because an analyst cannot tell it from a
rule that correctly matched nothing.

THE SHAPE
---------
A rule is a graph of pipeline STAGES plus a table of NAMED BINDINGS. That is the
single most important structural decision here, and it is what separates an
enterprise-capable model from a filter builder.

    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 10 | project T=TimeGenerated, Computer
    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4624 | project L=TimeGenerated, Computer
    <first> | join kind=inner (<second>) on Computer | where L between (T .. T+10m)

Nothing above is a linear chain. Both sides are defined, then joined, and the
surviving predicate compares a field from ONE row against a field from ANOTHER.
That last part is why `FieldRef` carries a scope. Without it, a rule comparing
two events' timestamps is inexpressible, and timestamp-ordered correlation --
the core of credential-access, lateral-movement and beaconing detection -- is
the one thing this tool most needs to model.

    and says nothing about which came first. But "procdump ran, THEN lsass was
    opened" is credential dumping, and the same two events in the other order
    are a memory tool being inspected. Lowering a sequence to a join doubles
    the matches and half of them are the benign direction -- reported as

    **`Correlation` loses the DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.** It counts how often ONE
    parent fired. A sequence's steps match different events, so collapsing
    them into a count asks "did any of these happen five times" instead of
    "did these specific things happen in this specific order".

    `by` is the join key shared by every step: the events must agree on it, or
    a sequence "by host.id" would match procdump on one machine followed by
    lsass access on another.

    `maxspan` bounds first step to last. Without it a sequence spans all of
    recorded history, so an attack chain and two unrelated events a year apart
    are the same finding.

    `until` is the terminator: when it matches, any partial sequence for that
    key is abandoned. It is how "logon then privilege escalation, UNLESS the
    user logged off in between" is expressed, and dropping it turns a
