"""The local HTTP API.

This is the seam between the engine and the browser. Everything the GUI can do
goes through here, and nothing here knows a vendor's syntax -- it asks the
dialect registry by key, exactly as the engine's layering requires.

Built on `http.server` rather than Flask or FastAPI, because the package has
zero third-party dependencies and that is a deliberate property: a detection
engineer can run this inside a locked-down SOC where `pip install` is not
available. `ThreadingHTTPServer` is more than enough for one analyst on
localhost, and the alternative would mean the tool cannot be used where it is
most needed.

Bound to 127.0.0.1 by default. This serves an endpoint that parses untrusted
rule text and evaluates rules against untrusted samples; it is a local
workbench, not a service, and binding it to a routable interface would make it
one. Doing that takes an explicit `--host`.

Every failure is a REFUSAL with a code and a reason, returned as JSON with
status 400. That is the same contract the engine uses internally, which is why
`Refusal.as_dict()` and `Diagnostic.as_dict()` already existed before anything
served them. Unexpected exceptions return a generic 500 and are logged to
stderr -- a traceback in a response body tells an attacker about the host and
tells the analyst nothing they can act on.
