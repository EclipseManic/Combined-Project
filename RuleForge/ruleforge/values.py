"""Value types and three-valued logic.

The rule this module exists to enforce:

    ABSENT   the field is not in the row
    NULL     the field is present and its value is null
    ""       the field is present and its value is the empty string

Those are three different things and a great deal of real detection breakage is a
rule quietly treating a missing field as an empty string. So the third value,
UNDECIDED, is a first-class citizen: a comparison that cannot be decided is
UNDECIDED, never False. `NOT UNDECIDED` is UNDECIDED.

Everything numeric goes through Decimal. Floats are coerced via Decimal(str(v))
so 0.1 + 0.2 does not become 0.30000000000000004 and quietly fail an equality
test against a value the analyst typed.
