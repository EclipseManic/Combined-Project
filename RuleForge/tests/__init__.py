"""RuleForge's test suite.

This file exists so `python -m unittest discover` recurses into this directory.
Without it unittest silently finds zero tests here and reports success, which
is the worst possible failure mode for a test suite: green because nothing ran.

It also holds `planned_dialect`, which several test modules need. All eight
dialects now ship, so there is no longer a real `planned` entry to point the
planned-dialect refusal tests at -- and those refusals are still live code
paths that a ninth dialect will land on. Rather than delete the tests (leaving
the paths untested) or pin them to a dialect that might ship (making them
assert the opposite of their name, which already happened twice here with
`sigma` and then `wazuh`), they run against a synthetic entry.
