"""IBM QRadar AQL.

`ClauseOrderIsNotExecutionOrder` is the class this module exists for. AQL is
SQL: the clauses are written in an order that is not the order they run, and
`ir.Rule.pipeline` is an ordered stream where stage N sees what stage N-1
produced. Lowering the clauses in written order puts the `SELECT` projection
first, which drops every column the later predicates read -- and a filter
reading an absent column goes UNDECIDED and reports a clean `no_match` on the
events the rule was written to catch.

`QuotingFollowsSql` is second in importance, and it is the one a reader coming
from the other dialects will get wrong. In AQL `'x'` is a string and `"x"` is a
COLUMN. Reading them the other way round turns `WHERE username = 'admin'` into
a comparison between two columns.
