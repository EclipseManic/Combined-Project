"""Splunk SPL.

Most of these tests are about the three things SPL does differently from every
other pipeline language, each of which is silent when it goes wrong:

`PrecedenceIsNotCLike` is the one to read first. Splunk evaluates OR BEFORE AND,
so `a=1 OR b=2 c=3` means `(a=1 OR b=2) AND c=3` -- the opposite of what the
shared default would give. Nothing warns, and the rule reads identically either
way; only the matched events differ.

`ImplicitAnd` exists because SPL writes nothing between ANDed terms. The shared
parser stops at the first term it cannot continue, so without normalisation the
rest of the search is silently unread and the rule matches far more than it says.

`CaseMattersInASearch` is the third: `AND` is an operator, `and` is a word to
search for.
