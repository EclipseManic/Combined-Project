"""Tests for validation and the deploy-path ReDoS screen.

The screen is the load-bearing part. A pattern that hangs an engine is refused
by `compile_pattern` when a rule is EXECUTED -- but a tool's job is also to
AUTHOR and RENDER rules, and those paths never executed anything. So the screen
is tested from `validate`, which every author and render path goes through.
