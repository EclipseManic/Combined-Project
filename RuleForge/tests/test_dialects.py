"""The dialect registry, and the vendor-isolation rule it protects.

`ruleforge/__init__.py` claims that nothing in the engine is allowed to know a
vendor exists, and that the rule is "enforced by a test rather than by good
intentions". That test did not exist. This is it.

The rest of this file is the other half of the same idea: the registry declares
what each dialect can do, and these tests import every ready dialect and check
the declaration against the module. A registry that claims a dialect can parse
when it cannot is worse than one that admits it cannot -- the first returns a
confident empty rule, the second refuses.
